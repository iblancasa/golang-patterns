# Factory
The Factory design pattern is all about creating objects without specifying the exact class or type of object that will be created. Imagine you’re running a coffee shop, and you have a machine that can make different types of coffee like espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Instead of having separate machines for each type of coffee, you have a single machine that can create any type of coffee based on what the customer orders. This machine acts like a “factory” that produces different types of coffee, but the customer doesn’t need to know how each type is made. They just request the coffee, and the machine handles the rest.

In programming, the Factory pattern works in a similar way. It provides a way to encapsulate the object creation logic. Instead of creating objects directly with new, you delegate the responsibility of creating objects to a factory method or function. This is particularly useful when the exact type of the object isn’t known until runtime, or when the creation process is complex.
